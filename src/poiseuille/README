/* Stability of stationary poisseuille pipe flow */

shoot - shooting algorithm finding least stable roots for omega (complex
	temporal frequency) for different Reynoldsnumbers R
shootxx - same as shoot, but written in C++ with complex<double>

shootsurf - as shoot, solves initial value ode, prints value at r=1 (which
	should be 0 if omega == eigenvalue. Least stable zeros of this height
	field, should be similar to `shoot'

shoothighr -  as shoot, but the limit for high Reynolds numbers R->infty

shootk - as shoot, but prints lines of constant k, with R as parameter. Output
	of both shoot, and shootk can be plotted together

shootlines - wrapper around shoot, and shootk, to produce the plot
